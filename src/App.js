/**
 * Parent Checklist Website
 * A JAMStack application which can take in a csv file lesson plan
 * 
 * Problem: it is difficult for parents to keep track of assignments
 * 
 * Solution: help parents and teachers keep track of remote learning assignemnts
 *  by creating an interactive household checklist which can take in school assignments
 *  and household chores, etc
 * 
 * Security: to keep things simple at launch we are not going to authenticate anything
 *  teachers, parents will not need to "log in"
 * 
 * Future Scope: add social login with 
 *  -- facebook -- or -- google
 *  -- set up a user profile looking for gravatar or FB image
 *     idea being that each lesson plan would have a profile image
 *     of the person who uploaded it as a mechanism by which
 *     parents can authenticate the validity of the lesson plans
 *     uploaded to the system
 *  
 * BackEnd WordPress: 
 * -- PHP will parse the csv lesson plan and return the json needed for the checklist
 * -- wordpress will create schools, classes, lesson plans, and lesson plans will contain assignments in post meta
 * -- the custom post type will be lesson plan. the meta will hold all other relevant data attached to the lesson plan
 * 
 * FrontEnd React:
 * -- Household: parents will add classes to students (household is "this" in the app js)
 * -- Students: classes will belong to students
 * -- Classes: which would be school, grade, subject, teacher
 * -- Lesson Plans: which would be assignments belonging to a class sharing a due date
 * -- Assignments: are the individual todos which belong to a lesson plan.
